4. Downloads in background (~5-20 MB delta update)
5. Prompts to restart
6. App updates automatically ✨
```

### **Portable Version**

2. Finds new version → Shows dialog
3. User clicks "Download"
4. Downloads full portable .exe (~214 MB)
5. User must manually replace old .exe
```

**Note:** Portable updates are larger because they download the full app, not just changes.
