# Testing Strategy Summary

**Executive Overview of Aurswift POS Testing Infrastructure**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a comprehensive, scalable, and maintainable testing strategy for Aurswift POS System that ensures code quality, reduces bugs, and enables confident refactoring.

## 📊 Test Pyramid Strategy

```
        E2E (2%)
       /         \
      /   UI (8%)  \
     /               \
    / Integration(10%) \
   /                     \
  /   Unit Tests (80%)    \
 /__________________________\
```

- **80% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for business logic
- **10% Integration Tests**: Multi-module interactions
- **8% Component Tests**: React component behavior
- **2% E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys
